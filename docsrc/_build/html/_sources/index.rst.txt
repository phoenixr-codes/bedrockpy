*bedrockpy* is a library that handles a websocket
connection between your Minecraft world and your
server. This library allows you to create custom
commands and react to several events.

.. note::
   This library is not meant for creating add-ons,
   plugins or similar things. If you are however
   looking for creating such creations, you might
   take a look at `Microsoft's official Minecraft
   Bedrock documentation
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/minecraft/creator/>`_.
   
   This library is meant to combine python knowledge
   with Minecraft or execute Python code on systems
   that do not provide full add-on support (such as
   Bedrock Edition on Consoles).
